                        <p>. Dambulla cave temple, also known as the Golden Temple of Dambulla, is a World Heritage Site in Sri Lanka, located in the country's central region. This location is 148 kilometers east of Colombo, 72 kilometers north of Kandy, and 43 kilometers north of Matale.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p1>. Dambulla is Sri Lanka's largest and best-preserved cave temple complex. The rock rises 160 meters above the surrounding plains. In the surrounding area, there are over 80 documented caves. The main attractions are spread across five caves that contain statues and paintings. These paintings and statues are inspired by Gautama Buddha's life. There are 153 Buddha statues in total, along with three statues of Sri Lankan kings and four statues of gods and goddesses. Vishnu and Ganesha are among the latter. The murals are 2,100 square meters in size. The temptation by the demon Mara and Buddha's first sermon are depicted on the cave walls.</p1>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p2>. Because there are burial sites with human skeletons about 2700 years old in this area, near the Dambulla cave complexes, prehistoric Sri Lankans would have lived in these cave complexes before the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.</p2>

                        <br>
                        <p>. This temple complex was constructed in the first century BCE. It has five caves carved into a massive overhanging rock with a drip line to keep the interiors dry. Arched colonnades and gabled entrances were added to the architecture in 1938. The ceilings of the caves are painted with intricate patterns of religious images that follow the contours of the rock. There are images of the Lord Buddha, bodhisattvas, and other gods and goddesses.</p>

                        <p1>. The Dambulla cave monastery is still in use and is the best-preserved ancient structure in Sri Lanka. This complex was established as one of the largest and most important monasteries in the third and second centuries BC. In the first century BC, Valagamba of Anuradhapura is thought to have converted the caves into a temple. Exiled from Anuradhapura, he sought refuge here for 15 years from South Indian usurpers. After reclaiming his capital, the King erected a temple to express his gratitude. Many other kings later added to it, and by the 11th century, the caves had become a major religious center, which they still are today.In 1190, Nissanka Malla of Polonnaruwa gilded the caves and added approximately 70 Buddha statues. The caves were restored and painted by the Kingdom of Kandy in the 18th century.</p1>

                            <p>. The temple is made up of five caves of varying size and splendor. The caves, built at the base of a 150m high rock during the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa periods, are by far the most impressive of Sri Lanka's many cave temples. Access is via the gentle slope of Dambulla Rock, which provides a panoramic view of the surrounding flat lands, including the rock fortress Sigiriya, which is 19 kilometers away. Hundreds of swooping swallows flock to the cave entrance at dusk.This spectacular cave is 7m tall at its highest point and measures about 52m from east to west and 23m from the entrance to the back. Hindu deities, as well as the kings Valagamba and Nissankamalla, and Ananda, the Buddha's most devoted disciple, are also depicted.</p>

                                    <p>. The first cave is known as Devaraja lena, which translates as "Cave of the Divine King." A 1st-century Brahmi inscription above the entrance to the first cave contains an account of the monastery's founding.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p1>. The 14-meter-tall Buddha statue hewn from the rock dominates this cave. It has been repainted numerous times throughout its history, with the most recent coat likely being applied in the twentieth century. Ananda, Buddha's favorite pupil, is at his feet, and Vishnu, who is said to have used his divine powers to create the caves, is at his head.</p1>

                                    <p> . In the second and largest cave, in addition to 16 standing and 40 seated Buddha statues, there are statues of the gods Saman and Vishnu, which pilgrims frequently decorate with garlands, and statues of King Vattagamani Abhaya, who honored the monastery in the first century BC, and King Nissanka Malla, who was responsible in the 12th century for the gilding of 50 statues, as indicated by a stone inscription near the monastery entrance. This cave is thus known as Maharaja lena, or "Cave of the Great Kings." The Buddha statue carved from the rock on the left side of the room is accompanied by wooden figures of the Bodhisattvas Maitreya and Avalokiteshvara or Natha.There is also a dagoba and a spring that drips water with healing properties from a crack in the ceiling. Tempera paintings on the cave ceiling from the 18th century depict scenes from Buddha's life, from Mahamaya's dream to the demon Mara's temptation. Other images depict significant events in the country's history.</p>

                                            <p>. Sri Dalada Maligawa, or Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, is a Buddhist temple in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is housed in the former Kingdom of Kandy's royal palace complex, which also houses the relic of the Buddha's tooth. The relic has played an important role in local politics since ancient times because it is believed that whoever holds the relic controls the governance of the country. Sinhalese kings have historically held the relic. The temple of the tooth is a World Heritage Site in part because of the temple and the relic.</p>
                                            <br>
                                            <p1>. Bhikkhus from two specific chapters, the Malwathu chapters and the Asgiri chapters, lead daily worship in the temple's inner chamber. Rituals are performed three times a day: at dawn, noon, and evening. On Wednesdays, the relic is symbolically bathed with Nanumura Mangallaya, a herbal preparation made from scented water and fragrant flowers; this holy water is believed to have healing powers and is distributed to those present.

                                                The temple was damaged by bombings carried out by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. It was, however, fully restored each time.</p1>

                                        <br>
                                        <p>. According to legend, after Gautama Buddha's Mahaparinirvana, the tooth relic was preserved in Kalinga and smuggled to the island by Princess Hemamali and her husband, Prince Dantha, on the orders of her father, King Guhasiva. On the way to the island, Hemmamali hid the relic in her hair. During the reign of Sirimeghavanna of Anuradhapura, they landed on the island of Lankapattana and handed over the tooth relic. The king enshrined it in Anuradhapura's Meghagiri Vihara. The monarch was responsible for safeguarding the relic from then on, so over time, the custodianship of the relic came to symbolize the right to rule the island.As a result, reigning monarchs built tooth relic temples close to their royal residences, as was the case during the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Polonnaruwa Kingdom, and Dambadeniya Kingdom. The relic was housed in Niyamgampaya Vihara during the reign of the Kingdom of Gampola. The temple of the tooth relic was located within the city of Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte when the Kingdom of Kotte was established, according to messenger poems such as Hamsa, Gira, and Selalihini.</p>

                                        <p>. During the reign of Dharmapala of Kotte, the relic was relocated and hidden in a grinding stone at Delgamuwa Vihara in Ratnapura. Hiripitiye Diyawadana Rala and Devanagala Rathnalankara Thera brought it to Kandy. King Vimaladharmasuriya I constructed a two-story building to house the tooth relic, which has since been demolished. When the Portuguese kingdom invaded Kandy in 1603, it was taken to Meda Mahanuwara in Dumbara.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p1>. It was rediscovered during the reign of Rajasinha II, who is said to have either restored the original structure or constructed a new temple. Vira Narendra Sinha constructed the current tooth temple. During the reign of Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the octagonal Paththirippuwa and moat were added. The Paththirippuwa was built by the royal architect Devendra Moolacharya. Originally used for recreational purposes by the king, it was later offered to the tooth relic and now houses the temple's library.</p1>

                                        <p>. The water waves wall is a brick wall that runs along the moat and the Bogambara lake. Holes in this wall are designed to illuminate coconut oil lamps. Mahawahalkada is the name of the main entrance gate that lies over the moat. A Sandakada pahana carved in Kandyan architectural style can be found at the foot of the Mahawahalkada steps. Mahawahalkada was completely destroyed in a bomb blast in 1998 and rebuilt alongside Sandakada pahana and other stone carvings. On either side of the entrance, elephants are carved in stone.</p>

Ranasinghe Premadasa, the then Prime Minister, built the golden canopy over the main shrine and the golden fence that encircles the temple complex in 1987. The tooth relic is housed in seven gold caskets encrusted with precious gemstones. The casket represents a stupa, and in the same chamber is displayed the procession casket used during the Kandy Esala Perahera.</p>
