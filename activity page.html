                <p>. It hasn't been long since surfing entered the frame of this magnificent island and exploded in popularity, making Sri Lanka a well-known tropical surf paradise.</p>
                <br>
                <p1>. There is a good reason for this. Warm water, palm-fringed sandy beaches, and a variety of surf spots for every taste and skill level: reef breaks, beach breaks, and point breaks. The key word is variety.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p2>. Perfect place to start or advance your surfing journey.</p2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p3>. To assist you, we created this Sri Lanka surf guide with all the information you need to know for the perfect surf getaway.</p3>

                        <p>. Because of its calm and predictable nature, the climate in Dambulla – Kandalama is ideal for ballooning. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p1>. Sri Lanka Balloon Rides are typically held in the early morning (when the weather is more stable), and the average distance we cover, depending on wind speed and direction, ranges from one to ten miles.</p1>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p2>. The altitude at which we fly will vary from tree top level – where we will enjoy low level contour flying – to several thousand feet up: the ideal vantage point to observe the majesty of the Dambulla – Kandalama area.</p2>

                            <p>. When visiting the Asian wonder that is Sri Lanka, your itinerary would be incomplete without a visit to one of the country's incredible Safaris.</p>
                            <br>
                                <p1>. When most people think of safaris, they think of Africa, but don't underestimate the value of a Sri Lanka safari.</p1>
                                <br>
                                <br>                               
                                <p>. It is easily one of the best things to do in Sri Lanka, and there was a LOT of choice when it came to deciding which safari in Sri Lanka I would choose.</p>
                                <br>
                               <p1>. So I figured a guide covering everything you need to know about safaris in Sri Lanka and highlighting the best safaris in Sri Lanka would be pretty useful to make your life a little easier.</p1>

                                <p>. Hiking in Sri Lanka is something that most tourists have fantasized about at some point. The country's name alone conjures up images of lush, green rainforest, rolling mountains, tropical wildlife, and turquoise water. The best hiking in Sri Lanka exemplifies this.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p1>. Lonely Planet named the country the "best country in the world" for travelers to visit in 2019. They praised its "rich and accessible wildlife," as well as the surf scene, culture, and people's friendliness.</p1>

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                    <p>. A lot of hiking in Sri Lanka takes place on well-traveled paths and routes. In the Knuckles mountain range, no. This is the route we take on our own adventure in Sri Lanka, taking a couple of nights to get through the Knuckles. Ruvi, an experienced local guide, told us that "even Sri Lankans don't really know the trail that we're hiking on," and joked that when he showed the photos to other guides upon his return from the route, they all wanted to go visit.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>                                    
                                    <p1>. The trail takes you deep into the rainforest and into the rugged wilderness of the Knuckles Range. The range got its name from its resemblance to a clenched fist. Consider yourself immersed in majestic mountains that rise up to 2000 meters. The scenery is dotted with massive cascading waterfalls.</p1>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                     <p2>. You pass through small villages and spend the night wild camping in the middle of nowhere. You'll almost certainly see buffalos, and if you're lucky, you might also see boars, toque macaques, and purple-faced monkeys. If you're really lucky, you might even see elephants and leopards in the jungle. Though the chances of running into them while hiking with their backpacks are slim.</p2>
